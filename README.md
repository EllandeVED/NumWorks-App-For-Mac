Hi, this is a small .app that serves as a NumWorksApp for Mac.
It looks like this:

And it has a setting panel where you can customise it (*See **INFO**)



## INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

- **Required: MacOS 14.0**
- Download the .zip file from the releases
- You will be faced with the following message when trying to open the app (because I don't have a registered develloper ID):

- Move the app to your application folder (optional) and you are all set!



## UPDATES:

- Follow in-app instructions
- Make to have your app inside the application folder for auto-updates to work without any trouble



## INFO:

- To access the settings (1) of the app, right click on the menu bar icon
- To access the settings (2) of the app, go on the top left of you screen in **"NumWorksApp"** and then go in **"Settings"**:
