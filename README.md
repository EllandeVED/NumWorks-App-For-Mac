Hi, this is a small .app that serves as a NuworksApp for Mac.

INSTRUCTIONS:

- Download the .zip file from the releases
- Move it to your application folder
- (You may need to authorize the launching of the app in Settings/Privacy and Security because I don't have a registered Developer ID)

INFO:

The app is a "web view", that means you need internet to launch it. (For the moment)
