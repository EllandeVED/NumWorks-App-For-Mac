(For version v1.4)

Hi, this is a small .app that serves as a NuworksApp for Mac.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

- Download the .zip file from the releases
- Move the resulting .app to your application folder
- (You may need to authorize the launching of the app in Settings/Privacy and Security because I don't have a registered Developer ID)

AVAILABLE SETTINGS:

  - "Launch at login" option
  - "Menu bar icon" option
  - A shortcut option to hide/show the app
  - "Open in current desktop" option

UPDATE

- The app doesn't auto-update, however, you will be notified when an update is available (at login or in settings)

INFO:

- You need internet at least once to load the calculator after you launch it.
- To access the settings of the app, go on the top left of you screen in "NumWorksApp" and then go in "settings".
