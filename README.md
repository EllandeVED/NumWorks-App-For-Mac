Hi, this is a small .app that serves as a NuworksApp for Mac.

INSTRUCTIONS:

- Download the .zip file from the releases
- Move the resulting .app to your application folder
- (You may need to authorize the launching of the app in Settings/Privacy and Security because I don't have a registered Developer ID)

INFO:

- You need internet at least once to load the calculator after you launch it.
- To access the setings of the app, go on the top left of you screen in "NumWorksApp" and then go in "settings". You will find:
  - "launch at login" option
  - "menu bar icon" option
  - a shortcut option to hide/show the app
