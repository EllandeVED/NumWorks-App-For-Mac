And it has a setting pannel where you can customise it (*See **INFO**)



## INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

- **Required: MacOS 14.0**
- Download the .zip file from the releases
- You will be faced with the following message when trying to open the app (because I don't have a registered develloper ID):

- Move the app to your application folder (optional) and you are all set!



## UPDATES

- The app doesn't auto-update, however, you will be notified when an update is available (at login or in settings)
- You need to delete the old version and replace it with the new one: when moving the new app to your application folder you will be prompted with the following message (see below), press **"Replace"**

## INFO:

- You need internet at least once to load the calculator after you launch it. It will stay loaded until you turn off your computer (working on an offline version)
- To access the settings of the app, go on the top left of you screen in **"NumWorksApp"** and then go in **"Settings"**:
